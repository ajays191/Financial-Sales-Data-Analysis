The Finance Sales Dashboard is a powerful tool that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance from a financial perspective. With a total sales record of $119 million and a remarkable $17 million in total profit, this dashboard offers a clear overview of revenue generation and net income after expenses. The incorporation of various charts, skillfully crafted in PowerPoint, enhances the visual representation of data. The dashboard analyzes sales by country, unit sales by product, and the distribution of products across segments and discounts, aiding in effective decision-making. Additionally, the profit trend of gross sales over the years helps identify patterns and trends, enabling users to capitalize on opportunities and drive profitability.
